      <p class="porsche-section"><strong>Important facts about porsche:</strong></p>
      <p class="porsche-section">"The 992 GT3 RS incorporates lightweight materials such as carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) to reduce overall weight and enhance agility on the track."</p>
      <ul class="porsche-section">
        <li>The 992 GT3 RS boasts advanced aerodynamics, featuring an enormous swan-neck rear wing and active aero elements. Its downforce at 124 mph (200 km/h) is 409 kg (902 lbs), nearly triple that of the 991.2 GT3 RS.</li>
        <li>The GT3 RS is inspired by Porsche's motorsport technology. It has a center-mounted radiator configuration, a concept borrowed from the Porsche 911 RSR and GT3 R race cars.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Track-Oriented Interior</h2>
      <p class="porsche-section">Inside, youâ€™ll find a stripped-down, functional cockpit with lightweight bucket seats, a roll cage (part of the Weissach package), and materials like Alcantara for a sporty feel.</p>
      <p class="porsche-section">The optional Weissach package takes performance further by adding more CFRP components, a carbon-fiber roll cage, and magnesium wheels to save additional weight.</p>
      <p class="porsche-section">Every detail on the GT3 RS is optimized for aerodynamics. Even the suspension arms are designed as wing profiles to contribute to overall downforce.</p>
